# Project Manager

This project is a simple Haskell app that will take the estimated cost for a Job and the actual cost for a Job, and calculate the difference.

The estimated cost for a Job is based on the amount of hours projected multiplied by the rate.

The actual cost for the project is based on the actual hours attached to the various Tickets/Issues associated with that Job, multiplied by the rate.

Jobs can be Grouped together and reported on. The results will be reported in the terminal.

Fake data is generated using a random number generator.
